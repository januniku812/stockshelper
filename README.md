# stockshelper
This repository is for returning the current stock prices for a excel with a column of stock tickers one wants to monitor/watch

**How to run**

To run download this as zip, extract into IntelliJ, open as project and replace the "highrisktradesinput.xlsx" with your wanted excel of stock tickers similar to the xlsx I already have. Make sure the name of 
your wanted to be monitered stock tickers is "highrisktradesinput.xlsx" or right click and under refactor rename highrisktradesinput.xlsx to your desired name for your input xlsx and IntelliJ will refactor all its
usages.

The slp_output.xlsx automatically changes/rewrites for every time StocksFileEditor.java is run and need not be tampered/edited.
